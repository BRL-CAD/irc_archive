Archived contents of BRL-CAD Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel

For many years, BRL-CAD utilized the Freenode IRC channel #brlcad for
discussion.  For most (although not quite all) of that time, a logging bot was
able to record transcriptions of those discussions.

Nowadays discussions tend to happen on other platforms, but the logs are
preserved here for reference and historical interest.
